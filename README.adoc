Middleman AsciiDoc (gem: *middleman-asciidoc*) is an extension for the {uri-middleman}[Middleman] static site generator that adds support for the {uri-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc] lightweight markup language.
Specifically, this extension converts AsciiDoc files in your site source to HTML pages.
This conversion is performed using {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] by default.

IMPORTANT: This extension is designed for Middleman >= 4.0.0.
Prior to Middleman 4, AsciiDoc support was part of Middleman core.

== Installation

If you're just getting started, first install the Middleman gem.

 $ gem install middleman

Then, generate a new project:

 $ middleman init MY_PROJECT

The project will be created in the MY_PROJECT directory.

If you're working with an existing project, you can skip the previous steps.

Next, add the gem for this extension to your project's [.path]_Gemfile_.

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'middleman-asciidoc'
----

Finally, run Bundler to install the dependencies using the `bundle` command:

 $ bundle

You're now ready to activate this extension and begin putting it to work.

== Activation and Configuration

To activate the AsciiDoc extension, add the following line to the [.path]_config.rb_ file for your site:

[source,ruby]
----
activate :asciidoc
----

You can also pass options to the extension.
One way is to pass a Hash of options as the second argument of `activate`.
In this case, the option keys must be expressed as symbols.

Here's an example of how to set the `attributes` option for this extension, which assigns attributes to the underlying Asciidoctor processor:

[source,ruby]
----
activate :asciidoc, attributes: ['source-highlighter=coderay']
----

Alternately, you can assign options directly to the extension object when using the block form of `activate`.
In this case, the options are properties of the extension object.

Here's how to assign the `attributes` option for this extension using the block form of `activate`:

[source,ruby]
----
activate :asciidoc do |asciidoc|
  asciidoc.attributes = ['source-highlighter=coderay']
end
----

The following option keys can be used to configure this extension.
With the exception of `layout`, these option keys map directly to options in the Asciidoctor API.

attributes (type: Hash or Array, default: [])::
Custom AsciiDoc attributes to pass to the processor.
The following implicit attributes are automatically appended to this collection.

* env=site
* env-site
* site-gen=middleman
* site-gen-middleman
* builder=middleman
* builder-middleman
* middleman-version=(value of `Middleman::VERSION` constant)
* imagesdir=(value of http_prefix + images_dir in app config)@
 ** skipped if `!imagesdir` is defined as a custom attribute
 ** can be overridden in page (hence the trailing @)

backend (type: Symbol, default: :html5)::
The moniker for a converter, which determines the output format to generate.

base_dir (type: String, default: :docdir)::
The base directory to use for the current AsciiDoc document.
If not specified, defaults to the document directory (i.e., `:docdir`).
To set the base directory to the source directory, use the keyword `:source` or the expression `app.source_dir`.
To leave the base directory undefined, use the value `nil`.

safe (type: Symbol, default: :safe)::
The safe mode level under which to run the AsciiDoc processor.

layout (type: String or Symbol, default: nil)::
The name of the default layout for AsciiDoc-based pages (pages processed by this extension, not including blog articles if a blog layout is specified).

TIP: The full set of options can be seen on your preview server's config page at the path [.path]_/__middleman/config/_.

== Creating Pages

Each AsciiDoc file in the source directory (except for files that begin with `+_+` or which are located in a directory that begins with `+_+`) becomes a page in the site.
AsciiDoc files can have the file extension `.adoc` or `.html.adoc`.
These extensions are stripped and replaced with the value of the `outfilesuffix` attribute, which defaults to `.html`.

NOTE: For details about how the file extension is substituted, see the discussion in https://github.com/middleman/middleman-asciidoc/issues/7[issue #7].

To add a page composed in AsciiDoc, simply add an AsciiDoc file that has one of the aforementioned AsciiDoc file extensions to the project source directory.

.sample.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
....
= Sample Page
:page-layout: page
:uri-asciidoctor: http://asciidoctor.org

This is a sample page composed in AsciiDoc.
The Middleman AsciiDoc extension converts it to HTML using {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor].

[source,ruby]
----
puts "Hello, World!"
----
....

=== Adding Custom Page Data

AsciiDoc attributes defined in the document header whose names begin with `page-` are promoted to page data (aka front matter).
The part of the name after the `page-` prefix is used as the entry's key (e.g., page-layout becomes layout).
The value is parsed as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML] data (that which can be expressed in a single line).

In addition to these explicit page attributes, the following AsciiDoc attributes are also promoted to page data:

* doctitle (i.e., the document title) (becomes title)
* author (becomes author.name)
* email (becomes author.email or author.url)
 ** if value matches the pattern `url[@username]`, author.username is also set
* authors (converted to an Array of Author objects)
* revdate (becomes date; value is converted to a Time object)
* keywords (value is kept as a String)
* description

TIP: You can continue to specify page data using the front matter header.
The AsciiDoc `page-` attributes override matching entries in the front matter header.

NOTE: If you specify a time zone in the value of the `revdate` attribute, that time zone is honored.
Otherwise, the date specified is assumed to have the time zone set for the application.
You can define the application time zone in [.path]_config.rb_ using `set :time_zone` (a setting shared with the blog extension).
If you don't specify a time zone in the page's date or for the application, dates are assumed to be UTC.

=== Specifying a Layout

The most important of these page attributes is `page-layout`, which determines the layout that is applied to the page.
Middleman will look for the first file that matches this root name under the source directory and use it as the layout.
For example, if `page-layout` has the value `page`, Middleman might resolve a layout named [.path]_page.erb_.
You can set the extension of the layout file using the `page-layout-engine` attribute.

If a layout is not specified, or the value of the `page-layout` attribute is empty, the default layout for the site is used.

You can set a default layout for all pages in [.path]_config.rb_ using:

[source,ruby]
----
set :layout, :name_of_layout
----

Alternately, you can set a default layout just for AsciiDoc-based pages (pages processed by this extension) in [.path]_config.rb_ using:

[source,ruby]
----
activate :asciidoc, layout: :name_of_layout
----

Finally, you can set the layout for a specific page or group of pages using the page directive.
This is an alternate way to define front matter for a page.

[source,ruby]
----
page 'home', layout: :name_of_layout
----

NOTE: The first argument to the `page` function is the page ID.
The page ID is computed starting from the path of the source file relative to the source directory, then removing the template extension (i.e., the AsciiDoc extension), then removing the `.html` extension, if present.
For example, the page ID for both [.path]_home.adoc_ and [.path]_home.html.adoc_ is `home`.

TIP: When you define the layout in [.path]_config.rb_, you can specify the value either as a String or a Symbol.

If you don't set the layout in [.path]_config.rb_, the default layout is considered unset.
(The one exception to this rule is the layout for blog articles, which is controlled by the configuration for the blog extension).

AsciiDoc-based pages are configured to use the automatic layout by default (i.e., the `page-layout` attribute is set to blank).
If you unset the `page-layout` attribute, the AsciiDoc processor will handle generating a standalone document (`header_footer: true`).
In this case, the page will appear like an HTML file that is generated by the AsciiDoc processor directly.

Here are the different ways to specify a layout:

* `:page-layout:`, `:page-layout: _auto_layout`, or _not specified_ -- use the automatic layout (default: layout)
* `:page-layout: custom` -- use the page layout named "`custom`" (e.g., [.path]_custom.erb_)
* `:!page-layout:` or `:page-layout: false` -- generate a standalone HTML document
* `:page-layout: ~` or `:page-layout: null` -- generate a page without a layout (don't wrap content in a layout)

.Layout for blog posts
WARNING: If you're using the Middleman Blog extension to write blog posts, the `layout` property on the blog configuration overrides the default layout, but you can still override that setting using the `page-layout` attribute in each post.

=== Ignoring a Page

In addition to the normal ignore filter in Middleman, you can also control whether a page is ignored from AsciiDoc.
To mark a page as ignored from AsciiDoc, set the `page-ignored` attribute in the AsciiDoc document header to any value other than `false`, as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Ignored Page
:page-ignored:
----

Once this page attribute is detected, no further processing is performed on the document by this extension.

=== Marking an Article as a Draft

If you're using the Middleman Blog extension, you can mark an article as a draft so it does not get published.
To do so, assign the value `false` the page attribute named `page-published` in the AsciiDoc document header, as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Draft Article
:page-published: false
----

This effectively sets the `published` key in the page data to `false`.
Recall that the AsciiDoc extension converts the value of page attributes as a YAML value, which means the string literal "`false`" becomes the boolean value `false`.
Middleman then knows not to publish this article.

Another option is to set the date of the article way into the future.

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Future Post
Author Name
3001-01-01
----

By default, the blog extension does not publish articles with a future date.

=== Linking Between Pages

You can link from one page to another using an {uri-asciidoctor}/docs/user-manual/#inter-document-cross-references[inter-document xref].
Let's say you have the following two pages in the source directory:

* about.adoc
* team.adoc

You can link from the about page to the team page using the following:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Meet our <<team.adoc#,team>>.
----

The `.adoc#` suffix indicates the xref targets another page.
The target is the path from the current page to the other page (a source-to-source reference).
This reference is then converted to the following HTML:

[source,html]
----
Meet our <a href="team.html">team</a>.
----

Of course, we're assuming there that the input maps 1-to-1 to the output.
That assumption breaks down as soon as you enable directory indexes.

When directory indexes are enabled, each page is moved into its own folder and renamed to index.html.
So how does the xref work in that case?

This extension provides built-in support for directory indexes.
When the directory indexes extension is enabled, this extension automatically defines the `relfileprefix` and `relfilesuffix` attributes on the AsciiDoc document.
The `relfilesuffix` attribute honors both the `:trailing_slash` and `:strip_index_file` options in Middleman.
However, you have to make one change to your pages for these attributes to work with the xref macro.

Below the document header (but *not in* the document header), you must assign the `outfilesuffix` attribute to the value of the `relfilesuffix` attribute.
Here's an example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= About Us

// ^ the previous blank line is required!
\ifdef::relfilesuffix[:outfilesuffix: {relfilesuffix}]

...

Meet our <<team.adoc#,team>>.
----

With the help of the `outfilesuffix` assignment, Asciidoctor automatically produces the correct link to the other page.

[source,html]
----
Meet our <a href="../team/">team</a>.
----

Optionally, you can construct the link manually using:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Meet our link:{relfileprefix}team{relfilesuffix}[team].
----

I think you'll agree that using the xref macro is simpler.

=== Controlling the Destination Path

By default, Middleman does not support controlling the destination path from the page data, often called a permalink.
However, with the addition of a simple extension, it's possible to enable this feature.

Start by adding the following Ruby code to the file [.path]_lib/permalink.rb_.

.lib/permalink.rb
[source,ruby]
----
class Permalink < Middleman::Extension
  # Run after front matter extension (priority: 20), after the AsciiDoc extension (priority: 30),
  # and before other third-party extensions (priority: 50).
  self.resource_list_manipulator_priority = 35

  def manipulate_resource_list resources
    resources.each do |resource|
      if !resource.ignored? && (resource.respond_to? :data) && (permalink = resource.data.permalink)
        permalink = permalink.slice 1, permalink.length if permalink.start_with? '/'
        resource.destination_path = %(#{permalink}#{resource.ext})
      end
    end
  end
end

Middleman::Extensions.register :permalink, Permalink
----

Next, require and activate this extension in the [.path]_config.rb_ file for your site:

[source,ruby]
----
require_relative 'lib/permalink'
activate :permalink
----

You can now customize the destination path for any AsciiDoc-based page by adding the following attribute entry to the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-permalink: custom-destination-path
----

Customize the destination path to your liking.
The leading forward slash (`/`) is optional.

== Building Your Site

You can now build your site using:

 $ middleman build

or preview it using:

 $ middleman serve

If you're using Bundler, use the following commands instead:

 $ bundle exec middleman build
 $ bundle exec middleman serve

== Community
